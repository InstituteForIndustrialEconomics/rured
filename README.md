Annotated files are in `annotation_files.zip` archive

the annotation.conf is used for brat (https://github.com/nlplab/brat)


So you may need to copy `annotation_files.zip` contents into `your_brat_folder/data`


annotation.conf should also be copied into `your_brat_folder/data`


`json_data.zip` contains posprocessed dataset with train/test/dev split
